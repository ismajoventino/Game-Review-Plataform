# Game Review Platform

## Description
This is a game review platform currently under development as part of my studies. The project is built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, and it aims to manage games and reviews, including adding, viewing, and updating game information. Although still under development, it demonstrates my understanding of backend development and Spring Boot concepts.

## Features (Planned)
### Game Management:
- Add new games to the platform.
- View a list of all games.
- Find a specific game by its ID.
- Update game information.

### Review Management:
- Add reviews for specific games.
- View reviews for a game.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend and RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database operations, allowing interaction with the database using repositories.
- **Maven**: For dependency management.

# What I learned

- **Spring Boot**: Gained experience in building RESTful APIs and managing dependencies.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Learned how to interact with databases using repositories.
- **Java**: Improved my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and backend development principles.

# Next Steps

- Complete the implementation of the game and review management features.
- Test the application to ensure it works correctly.
- Add a frontend interface to make the platform more user-friendly.
